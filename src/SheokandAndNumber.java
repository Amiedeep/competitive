//Sheokand is good at mathematics. One day, to test his math skills, Kaali gave him an integer N. To impress Kaali, Sheokand has to convert N into an integer M that can be represented in the form 2x+2y (where x and y are non-negative integers such that xâ‰ y). In order to do that, he can perform two types of operations:
//
//        add 1 to N
//        subtract 1 from N
//        However, Sheokand is preparing for his exams. Can you help him find the minimum number of operations required to convert N into a valid integer M?
