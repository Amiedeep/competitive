//In a regular table tennis match, the player who serves changes every time after 2 points are scored, regardless of which players scored them.
//
//        Chef and Cook are playing a different match â€” they decided that the player who serves would change every time after K points are scored instead (again regardless of which players scored them). When the game starts, it's Chef's turn to serve.
//
//        You are given the current number of points scored by Chef and Cook (P1 and P2 respectively). Find out whether Chef or Cook has to serve next.
